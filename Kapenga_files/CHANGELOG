This is a quadratic equation solver  qsolve_roots.c 
  int qsolve_roots(double a, double b, double c, double *x1, doube *x2)
its header file is  qsolve_roots.h
  
as well as unit test files for qsolve_roots.x qsolvce_roots.h 

Version Future
	Validate input
	Add logging
	Reduce roundoff and add warnings 
	unit test unstable problem
	unit test boundary conditions 

Version 0.82 under development
	Added
		tmonkey.c simple monkey tests 
		test_discriminant.c development checks for discriminant < 0
			do to roundoff when it should be == 0
	Updated
		qsolve_roots so *x1 and *x2 are not modified on failure ret > 1
		t1 and t2 should check that x1 and x2 are not changed if ret > 1

Version 0.81
	Added	
		t2.c tests for simple solutions that should be near exact

	Updated
		qsolve_roots.c return roots so that x1 <= x2
		
Version 0.80 
	Added 
		t1.c tests where simple solutions should be exact
		README
		CHANGELOG
	Updated 
		comments to the top of qsolve_roots.c
		Makefile for t1 and cunit.h in another directory

Version 0.5
	initial code and a first set up of units tests in t0.c
	qsolve_roots.c missing critical comments
