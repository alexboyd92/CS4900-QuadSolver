This document contains coding standards.

Camel casing should be used for variable names

Function names should start with capital letters and be descriptive.
Any additional words should be capitalized and no spaces.
  example. PrintINT(int a) - would be expected that it prints an INT a

Comments should be used to show the start and end of functions

  //--Main--//
  main{

  }//end main

Control statements should be commented above the statement if necessary.
closing brackets should be commented as well

//if statement to control input validation
 if(valid){
 
 }//end if
