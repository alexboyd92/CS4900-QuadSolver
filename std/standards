This document contains coding standards used in the quadsolver project.

For development environment we use Atom with beautify and github plugins.

makefile standards
  Each makefile should contain the following

  CC = gcc
  CFLAGS = -ggdb -Wall -pedantic -std=gnu11


Commenting Standards
1.Control statements should be commented above the statement if necessary.
closing brackets should be commented as well if the block is larger than a few lines

//if statement to control input validation
 if(valid){

 }//end if valid

2. Comments should be used to show the start and end of functions

   //--Main--//
   main{

   }//end main


Formatting standards
General
1. Indentation should be handled by beautify plugin for atom text editor

Variables
1. Camel casing should be used for variable names
2. variables should have meaningful names or otherwise commented during
    initialization.
3. Variables should be set with a value when declared.
    int aTestVariable = 0;
    char x = "" ;


Functions
1. Function names should start with capital letters and be descriptive.
  Any additional words should be capitalized and no spaces.
  example. PrintINT(int a) - would be expected that it prints an INT "a"

2.Functions should only have one return statement.

3.Functions should be broken up as much as possible to make them easier to read.
